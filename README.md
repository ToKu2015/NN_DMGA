Neural Networks based on Distance Measures 

This repo provides an implementation of a neural network based on distance measures and Gaussian activation function. It should reproduce the results on permutation invariant MNIST reported in the paper:

    Thomas Kurbiel, Shahrzad Khaleghian, 
    Training of Deep Neural Networks based on Distance Measures using RMSProp, 
    arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.01911 (2015) 
    available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01911.pdf

Please copy the two MATLAB helper functions "loadMNISTImages" and "loadMNISTLabels" for extracting the data. These functions are available at http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/resources/mnistHelper.zip.

The MNIST dataset can be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
